1. How many memories are used in the single-cycle MIPS processor : 2
2. What is a pipeline flush : force a signal or a register to 0
3. What is PC absolute addressing? Is it used in MIPS : The effective address for an absolute instruction address is the address parameter itself with no modifications and we have it in a mips
4. What is the “function” field (from instruction format) used for : The function field of the instruction determines the ALU operation ( R Type )
5. Write RTL abstract for the following instruction: jr : jr $rs R PC<-RF[rs]
6. Write RTL abstract for the following instruction: sllv : (shift left logical variable ) : d <- t<<s
7. How many registers are in the MIPS Register File?
8. Who is responsible for filling the branch delay slot?
9. What is a control hazard?
10. Give an example of a RAW data hazard.
11. Give an example of µInstruction encoding.
12. How is the SLT operation implemented in an ALU?
13. What is the binary number representation used in today processors? 1’s or 2’s complement? Why?
14. What is register renaming?
15. What is a 2-bit predictor (branch prediction)?
16. What is a cache memory?
17. What is AMAT?
18. What is a BHT (bimodal branch prediction)? Where does its address come from?
19. What is a TLB (virtual memory)?
20. What is temporal locality (caches)?
